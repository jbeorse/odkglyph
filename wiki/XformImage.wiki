#summary Explain how to link to the correct image

= Introduction =

We allow two method to specify images. 

= Details =
We support image by specifying img tag in the label element

== First == 

The image is specified with the image filename in attribute img

{{{
<label img="imagefile">question content?</label>
}}}

In the ODK collect app, imagefile is stored in path /sdcard/odk/forms/ form_name/imagefile.
The same path is used to find the image. 

For example: 
In our demo_form.xml, 
{{{
<label img="gallery_photo_4.jpg">What do you think about this pix?</label>
}}}

The image will be stored in /sdcard/odk/forms/ demo_form/gallery_photo_4.jpg

== Second == 

We can have multi-images using iimage framework inside model. 
{{{
<iimage>
<imageSet setName="setname">
<image id="id">image_filename1</image>			
<image id="id"> image_filename2 </image>	
â€¦		
</imageSet></iimage>
</model>
}}}

The image_filename1 and image_filename are stored in the location as described in _FIRST_ part

In your question label, you can link to the image set with setname
{{{
<label img="jr:iimage('setname')">question content?</label>
}}}

For example: 
In our demo_form.xml, we have image set 
{{{
<iimage>
<imageSet setName="Q1">
<image id="img_1">gallery_photo_1.jpg</image>			
<image id="img_2">gallery_photo_2.jpg</image>	
<image id="img_3">gallery_photo_3.jpg</image>		
</imageSet>
</iimage>
}}}

the set can be linked using 
{{{
<label img="jr:iimage('Q1')">What do you think about these photos?</label>
}}}
