ODK Glyph:  Image Based Questions and Answers
There are several NGOs who work with indigenous people and let them collect data on issues important to them.  Many in these tribes speak/read/write in only their native tongue, so these populations would be better served by allowing for images to be questions and answers. This project involves extending ODK Collect's widgets to allow for images to be the questions, and also for images to be answers in select-one (radio buttons) and select-multi (checkboxes) questions.

In addition to allowing images for questions and answers via an expanded XML schema, our end product will have a practical storage structure that determines the directory format.  The images will be downloaded and stored locally with some type of identifier that ties it to an answer or question.  Additional functionality may include a way to upload/download question and answer image sets in zip files or directories.  We will have to determine the best way to display the images.


Technologies used: ODK Collect on Android (Java), some JavaROSA (Java), XForms (xml)
